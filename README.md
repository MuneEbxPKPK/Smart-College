<h1 align="center">Smart College</h1>
<h3 align="center">An IoT Project for PGC Robotics Exhibition Rawalpindi-Islamabad 2024</h3>


- üå± This Project showcases a way to automate our colleges by introducing many Smart Features using IoT



<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- The Project offers Multiple features.-> Blynk App To Control LEDs And Door Locks.
- A Face attendance system using Face Recognition Libraries in Python for students
- An Hazard Detection System For security of Students. This systen detects Bad Air Quality, Flood Detection, Temperature, Humidity and Earthquake. If any danger is detected, Buzzer is used as an emergency alarm.
- An AI Assitant build using JavaScript using built in libraries and functions along with HTML and CSS

<h2 align="center" color="yellow">Structure</h2>

- It consists of 3 Floors, 1 Building for Parking, 1 small Building For Microcontrollers and other stuff, and 1 Caffetaria.
- On Every Floor there are few rooms.
- 
<h3 align="center">Ground Floor</h3>

- On ground floor, there is a Principal office, Reception, Satffroom and Bathrooms.
- Reception is the place where AI assistant is placed. On Ground Floor Almost all the Hazard Detection sensors are located.
- There are also Small LEDs Attached to the walls controlled by Blynk App.

<h3 align="center">First Floor</h3>

- On First Floor, there are two classrooms and some other rooms.
- There are LEDs on the walls. Doors of the Classrooms are secured and can be locked from Blynk App.
- Cafetaria is also located on first floor. It has a sheet which will open when rain sensor detects rain.

<h3 align="center">Second Floor</h3>

- On the Last floor, there are another 2 classrooms and labs.
- LEDs are attached to the walls and doors of classrooms can be locked from Blynk App.
- There is a small so called area in the front of the second floor where you can add chaira and other stuff for better look, which will be a TODO.

<h3 align="center">Parking Building</h3>
- It consists of two Floors
- There are also two lifts installed on the back side to transfer a vehicle from Ground to First floor of parking (Lift 1).
- Second lift is used to transfer Cars from first floor to ground floor of the Parking (Lift 2).
- The Entry and Exit are also part of the parking system. The reason for this barrier-checkup is again to ensure security. HOW? Well This is completely up to the security team that which cars should be allowed to enter and which should be stopped. But for normal cars, It is fully Automatic.
- There are some colorful LEDs attached alongside the road just for a good look and can also act as street lights.
<b>TODO: </b> You can add another button on the security check post that you will create if you want. Purpose of this button will be to stop unauthorize cars. Who will press this button? If security team sense any danger from a car it can stop the barrier to open by simple pressing that button.

<h3 align="center">Control Room</h3>
- This room will be a main hub from where the whole college will be controlled.
- In reality there will be computers and screens to monitor the college but in our case we have put all microcontrollers, batteries and breadboards in the room.
<b>TODO: </b> Use multiple breadboards to manage jumper wires.

<h3 align="center">Roof</h3>
-  Nothing special in the roof but Solar Panels with auto rotation are installed there.
<b>TODO: </b> Add at least 2 solar panels with auto rotation.
